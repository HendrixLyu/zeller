This practical code test is for a React front-end application, developed using TypeScript as the programming language, with Mui and styled-components for CSS styling. It employs the Jest testing framework in combination with React Testing Library and the testing library provided by Apollo Client (@apollo/client/testing) for testing React components that interact with GraphQL APIs.
